This program reads /var/db/pkg/local.sqlite and compares
install timestamp with date in $FreeBSD header in the
Makefile of the port. If there is no $FreeBSD header
then it is assumed to be a beta port.
At the moment it displays the timestamp in the db
and the timestamp parsed in the Makefile, for debug
purposes.
