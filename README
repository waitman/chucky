chucky

Copyright 2013 Waitman Gobble <ns@waitman.net>

see COPYING for details


This program reads /var/db/pkg/local.sqlite and compares install timestamp with
date in $FreeBSD header in the Makefile of the port. If there is no $FreeBSD
header then it is assumed to be a beta port.

 Command line switches:
                -u      show ports with update status only
                -o      show ports with current status only
                -b      show ports with beta status only
                -t      show timestamps (debug, etc)
                -a      create shar of files (usefull with -a). output to stdout
                -h      help

NOTE: shar files are created with absolute path (ie /usr/ports/src/dir)
so executing them will restore to that path. Multiple shars are concatenated
by chucky stripping the 'exit' command from the output. (ie there is no 'exit'
in the shar output. the shar output is to stdout, if you want to save:

# chucky -b -a > save.shar

This will save all the ports marked 'beta' in the save.shar archive,
in the cwd.

Edit Makefile if you dont put stuff in /usr/local

example:
# chucky

 {OK}		p:1359956798 i:1363325950       x11/xpr 1.0.4
 {OK}		p:1342304958 i:1363325954       x11/xprop 1.2.1
 {beta}		p:---------- i:1363045617       x11/xproto 7.0.22
 {OK}		p:1362771552 i:1363325959       x11/xrandr 1.4.0
 {updates}	p:1366304958 i:1363325962       x11/xrdb 1.0.9

{OK} means there is no update available
{beta} is a beta port
{updates} means the version in /usr/ports is newer than install date

the right columns show the port location, ie /usr/ports/x11/xrdb
and the version currently installed on the system.

depends on /var/db/pkg/local.sqlite which is managed by the pkg system.
(see /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/pkg)

man page is installed in /usr/local/share/man/man7, if you do not yet 
have the configuration in /etc/man.conf, add 

MANPATH /usr/local/share/man
